# 🧠 Piyush Koundal — Developer Portfolio

A fully custom, high-performance **developer portfolio** designed and built from scratch.  
Showcasing my work, creativity, and technical skills with modern web technologies — blending animation, performance, and minimalist design and yes I built it just from scratch.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This portfolio represents my journey as a **Frontend & Full-Stack Developer**, featuring smooth animations, a responsive layout, and clean UI.  
It combines **React, Framer Motion, GSAP, Lenis**, and optimized rendering techniques to ensure a cinematic yet performant browsing experience.

Built entirely from scratch — **no templates, no frameworks beyond the essentials** — this project demonstrates my design sensibility and technical depth.
